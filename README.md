# evcs – Electrical Vehicle Charging Station

This django application is an extension for [mmetering](http://mmetering.chrisonntag.com) in order to model an electrical vehicle charging station, where users identify themselves through an RFID chip mapped to their apartment.

The energy consumption is then written to the corresponding apartment.
